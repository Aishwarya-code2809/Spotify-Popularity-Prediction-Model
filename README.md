# Spotify-Popularity-Prediction-Model

Predicting a song's popularity has become a significant challenge for artists, producers, and streaming services due to the millions of songs that are released on music streaming platforms every year.  The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict the popularity score of Spotify tracks by examining their metadata and audio characteristics.

 Based on a song's musical qualities, the system determines its likelihood of popularity by identifying patterns in vast amounts of Spotify data.
